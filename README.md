===========

Yet another config file of Xmonad. Programs used for this configuration:

 * xmonad, xmonad-contrib
 * xmobar
 - A Nerdfont -- It's important

I reduce the keybinds to minimal, the really useful keys. I have some workaround the theme but there parts where lacks customize.

One important thing: The Workspaces are the numpad(too you can use numbers row). Well I want to say you, can navigate between workspaces with arrows keys.


- I would like a displayable menu with keybinds and its meaning. TODO:
- Finish convert strings to icons
- Add the .desktop file

Preview
-------

The bar is xmobar. The editor is neovim-qt. And launcher rofi. As well standalonetray in the desktop background. Compton with default is "fine"
